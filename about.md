Hi! I am Srinath, a final year undergraduate student majoring in Physics and Computer Science at BITS Pilani Goa Campus.

I am a passionate AI nerd thoroughly excited about topics revolving Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning, and Natural Language Processing. In this blog I hope to write about my toy projects, summaries of important research papers I have read, and posts about important AI topics. This is to enforce a discipline to document my work and bring clarity in my understanding.
