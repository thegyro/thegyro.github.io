Hi! I am Srinath Rajagopalan, a final year undergraduate student majoring in Physics and Computer Science at BITS Pilani Goa Campus.

I hope to write about my toy projects, summaries of important research papers, and posts about interesting AI topics. Hopefully this enforces a discipline to document my work and bring clarity in my understanding.
