Hi! I am Srinath, a final year undergraduate student majoring in Physics and Computer Science at BITS Pilani Goa Campus.

I am a passionate AI nerd thoroughly excited about topics revolving Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and Natural Language Processing.

In this blog I hope to write about my toy projects, summaries of important research papers I have read, and posts about important AI topics. This is to enforce a discipline to document my work and bring clarity in my understanding.

The blog title is lifted from lectures in Artificial Intelligence course from Berkeley which kickstarted my interest in AI.

I am shamelessly overambitious, technologicially exuberant, and irritatingly inqusitive. If you have explosive thoughts about any interesting topic, feel free to drop an email!
