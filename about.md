Hi! I am Srinath Rajagopalan, a final year undergraduate student majoring in Physics and Computer Science at BITS Pilani Goa Campus.

In this blog I hope to write about my toy projects, summaries of important research papers I have read, and posts about important AI topics. This is to enforce a discipline to document my work and bring clarity in my understanding.
